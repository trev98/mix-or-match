# Know your sake!
## There are many types of sake with different characteristics. Some sake is polished, some unfiltered and others are diluted. There are many ways to create this drink which makes each and every one of them unique. This game is designed so the player can know the type of sake as well as some of its characteristics. This is game is for my milestone project and I was inspired to make this game to help my partner learn more about sake and its characteristics for her new job.
### Match the sake and its definition before the time runs out! There are two types of the same cards, 8 different cards, 16 cards in total. Click on the cards to flip them, remember were they are and learn a little bit about sake!
